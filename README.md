This program has been created for the New Providence Community Pool. 
Its purpose is to optimize the rotation schedule of lifeguards for the day. 
"Optimizing" refers to making sure the lifeguards are each treated fairly by equally distributing how long the lifeguards are up on stand at any given time.
It also takes into account different types of down stands that occur at different times throughout the day.
The goal is to make the process of creating the rotation schedule not only faster but attempt to make the mathematically most optimal rotation schedule possible.
